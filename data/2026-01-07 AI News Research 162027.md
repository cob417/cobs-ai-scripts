## SECTION 1 — Emerging Themes (3–5)

**1) AI is entering its “prove ROI” era, not its “bigger models” era.**  
The most consistent message is that budgets and board attention are shifting from capability demos to measurable business outcomes (cost takeout, revenue lift, cycle-time reduction). This reframes GenAI roadmaps toward workflow redesign, integration, and adoption—where most enterprise programs currently stall.  
Who’s saying it: financial reporters; business outlets; enterprise analysts.

**2) Agentic AI is moving from pilots to workforce-scale deployment—but reliability and governance are the bottleneck.**  
Articles highlight rapid experimentation with “digital workers,” alongside a growing realization that autonomy without controls creates operational and compliance risk. The practical focus is shifting to orchestration, permissions, audit trails, and human-in-the-loop escalation patterns.  
Who’s saying it: enterprise analysts; Fortune 500 engineering teams; technical journalists.

**3) “Agent-ready” data and systems are becoming the gating factor for AI agents.**  
Multiple sources converge on a hard constraint: agents need clean, accessible, well-indexed data plus modern APIs and identity controls to act safely. Organizations are learning that agent performance often fails for non-model reasons—messy data, brittle integrations, and legacy architectures.  
Who’s saying it: enterprise analysts; practitioner authors; systems/infra engineers.

**4) The human side is becoming the constraint: reskilling, operating models, and new job composition.**  
Coverage emphasizes that the workforce impact is less about blanket headcount reduction and more about role reshaping and supervision of AI systems. Companies are beginning to quantify “AI + human” staffing mixes, and leaders are signaling continuous reskilling as a baseline expectation.  
Who’s saying it: business outlets; executives; management consultants.
