SECTION 1 — Emerging Themes (3–5)

**1) “Agentic AI” is moving from demos to production—and standards are forming around it.**  
Open standards and governance are becoming a prerequisite as agents touch real workflows (coding, ops, commerce) and need portability across tools. The push toward shared specs (e.g., MCP/AGENTS.md) is also a signal that the ecosystem is trying to avoid fragmented, vendor-locked “agent stacks.”  
Who’s saying it: developer advocates; open-source stewards; platform engineering teams

**2) Physical AI + industrial digital twins are becoming the next marquee battleground.**  
CES coverage shows the center of gravity shifting from chat to embodied/industrial systems: simulation-first design, digital twins, and “AI operating systems” for factories and supply chains. This matters because it expands AI ROI from knowledge work into capex-heavy domains where gains can be structural (throughput, downtime, energy).  
Who’s saying it: industrial tech executives; business outlets; manufacturing technologists

**3) The “prove ROI” era is here—agents must be reliable and measurable to scale.**  
2026 narratives emphasize that model quality alone won’t win; organizations are demanding payback, integration discipline, and reduced variance through deterministic systems. This theme matters because it reframes budgets from experimentation to operationalization—and exposes “agent washing” risks.  
Who’s saying it: enterprise analysts; financial reporters; Fortune 500 engineering teams

**4) AI regulation and IP risk are tightening into an operational constraint, not a policy side quest.**  
Courts and states are actively shaping what’s permissible (copyright fair use, deepfakes, employment disclosures), forcing AI teams to treat compliance as part of deployment architecture. This matters because the cost of being wrong is rising (litigation, takedowns, blocked rollouts), and it influences data strategy and vendor selection.  
Who’s saying it: legal reporters; policy specialists; compliance leaders
