# SECTION 1 — Emerging Themes (3–5)

- **Big Tech is buying (and regulating) agent capability like strategic infrastructure.**  
  Meta’s acquisition of Manus—and China’s reported export-control review—signals that “agent IP” is now treated like national-importance technology, not just software. It also highlights a new M&A risk surface: cross-border workforce/technology relocation and licensing constraints can shape or delay deals.  
  Who’s saying it: financial reporters; regulatory watchers; Big Tech strategists

- **2026 is the “prove ROI” year for GenAI and agents—not the “bigger model” year.**  
  Coverage is converging on a pragmatic shift: enterprises are moving from demos to measurable task outcomes (cost, speed, reliability), with many agent pilots expected to stall if they can’t justify integration and operational overhead. The market narrative is increasingly about adoption capacity inside orgs (process change, governance, skills), not just model capability.  
  Who’s saying it: major business outlets; enterprise analysts; operators

- **Agent reliability is becoming an engineering discipline (not a prompt trick).**  
  Practitioner commentary emphasizes that agents fail in production for predictable reasons: brittle tool use, poor state management, unclear guardrails, and limited observability. The “agent stack” conversation is shifting toward testing, monitoring, evals, and controlled autonomy (permissions, rollback, audit trails).  
  Who’s saying it: practitioner engineers; developer advocates; technical editors

- **Compute and systems design are being reframed around long-context and “agentic” workloads.**  
  Nvidia’s CES announcements frame next-gen platforms around scaling inference and long-context memory, implying that the dominant workloads are moving beyond single-turn chat into multi-step planning, retrieval, and action loops. Hardware/software co-design, memory tiers, and networking become first-order constraints for agent deployments.  
  Who’s saying it: semiconductor reporters; infrastructure analysts; platform engineering teams

- **“Digital workforce” language is going mainstream inside enterprises.**  
  Reporting on McKinsey’s use of thousands of internal AI agents reflects a broader pattern: firms are beginning to manage agents as capacity (roles, oversight, performance) rather than as features inside tools. This reframes workforce planning, operating models, and controls around human+agent collaboration.  
  Who’s saying it: management leaders; enterprise operators; workforce strategists
