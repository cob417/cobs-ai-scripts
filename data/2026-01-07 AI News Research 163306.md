SECTION 1 — Emerging Themes (3–5)

1) ROI pressure is replacing “model race” hype  
Enterprises and investors are shifting from chasing the best model to demanding measurable productivity and profit. This is forcing tighter scoping, better integration with deterministic systems, and clearer accountability for outcomes.  
Who’s saying it: financial reporters; enterprise operators; business outlets

2) “Reliable agents” is the new battleground (verification, guardrails, governance)  
Agent deployments are hitting limits from error compounding, unclear autonomy boundaries, and security/compliance risks. The next wave emphasizes self-checking, observability, and policy-enforced controls so agents can run multi-step workflows safely.  
Who’s saying it: developer advocates; enterprise security leaders; technical publications

3) AI infrastructure is pivoting toward agentic workloads (not just training)  
New platform announcements highlight that inference, orchestration, and memory/context handling are becoming first-class infrastructure requirements. This reframes spend from “bigger models” to “systems that can run many interacting models/tools efficiently.”  
Who’s saying it: chip/infrastructure analysts; tech business reporters; platform engineering teams

4) Energy and geopolitics are now core AI strategy inputs  
Power availability, data center constraints, and export controls increasingly shape where AI capacity can be built and how fast it can scale. Competitive advantage is starting to look like “access to electrons + compute + supply chain,” not only algorithms.  
Who’s saying it: global markets reporters; geopolitical/economic commentators; enterprise strategists
