# SECTION 1 — Emerging Themes (3–5)

## 1) AI buyers are shifting from “model wow” to ROI, reliability, and integration
As model performance gains normalize, the differentiator is proving measurable business value and fitting into existing workflows. Enterprises are also learning that agent rollouts get messy without deterministic backstops, strong governance, and human-in-the-loop design.  
Who’s saying it: business outlets; enterprise analysts; Fortune 500 engineering teams

## 2) Agentic UX is moving from chat to “computer-/phone-using” assistants
Instead of prompting inside a chat box, the newest assistants operate interfaces directly (browsers, apps, enterprise suites), which broadens automation but raises safety, permissions, and auditability demands. This also increases pressure for standards and “systems of record” to manage many agents across a company.  
Who’s saying it: practitioner teams; developer advocates; enterprise SaaS reporters

## 3) The AI supply chain is re-accelerating around next-gen chips and constrained compute
CES announcements underscore that compute remains the limiting factor, pushing rapid iteration in datacenter GPUs/CPUs and renewed focus on performance-per-watt. Hardware competition (and geopolitical export policy) is shaping what models and agents can be deployed, where, and at what cost.  
Who’s saying it: financial reporters; semiconductor beat reporters; cloud infrastructure teams

## 4) Copyright and regulation are becoming core product strategy, not a side issue
Court decisions on training data fair use and tightening enforcement around major platforms are influencing which datasets can be used, how products are shipped, and whether licensing becomes mandatory. This directly impacts foundation-model economics and the defensibility of AI-agent products trained on broad corpora.  
Who’s saying it: legal reporters; policy analysts; enterprise risk leaders
