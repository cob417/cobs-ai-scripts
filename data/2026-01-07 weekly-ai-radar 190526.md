# SECTION 1 — Emerging Themes (3–5)

## 1) “Show me the money” replaces model-chasing as the core AI narrative
ROI, measurable productivity, and real deployments are becoming the gating factors for budgets in 2026—not benchmark bragging rights. This shift is forcing teams to prioritize workflow integration, reliability, and change management over raw capability gains.  
Who’s saying it: financial reporters; enterprise operators; CIO-focused outlets

## 2) Agentic AI moves from demos to “digital workforce” experiments—and backlash risk rises
Organizations are increasingly treating agents as semi-autonomous workers (with permissions, identities, and performance expectations), not just chat interfaces. The downside is that governance, auditability, and safety controls often lag—creating “agent washing” confusion and failed rollouts.  
Who’s saying it: enterprise analysts; Big 4 advisors; Fortune 500 engineering teams

## 3) Geopolitics is reshaping AI M&A and cross-border model/agent commercialization
High-profile deals are now entangled with export controls and regulatory scrutiny, affecting where talent and IP can move. This injects new uncertainty into acquisition strategies and “Singapore washing” style corporate relocations.  
Who’s saying it: major business outlets; policy/regulatory reporters; multinational tech leadership

## 4) AI infrastructure roadmaps are being re-justified around agentic workloads
Compute platforms and chip roadmaps are being framed around agentic AI requirements (reasoning, multi-step planning, tool use, continuous operation). This reinforces infrastructure spending—even as application-layer startups face tougher differentiation tests.  
Who’s saying it: semiconductor analysts; venture investors; enterprise infrastructure leaders
